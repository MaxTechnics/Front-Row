# Front Row for Mac OS X Lion and Mountain Lion
A tool to restore (partial) Front Row functionality on newer Mac OS versions. It's basic.

## How to use
Go to releases, then download the pkg for your version of Mac OS X
Open it and follow the steps in the installer.

### Notice
Unfortuntately, I was not able to get Front Row working on OS X Mavericks and up. If i end up finding a way, I will add it here.

## Limitations
### Lion
On OS X Lion, Front Row works almost as usual. Though it might not find music in your iTunes library if you have a newer verion of iTunes above iTunes 10.3.

### Mountain Lion
On OS X Mountain Lion, all IR Remote functionality has been lost. I haven't been able to find a suitable fix yet. It also wouldn't launch without pressing escape after opening. This is the AppleScript you find around the webs. It has been compiled with the Front Row icon to make it function as normal.
